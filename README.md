# AgreeX - Powered by OKX DEX

## Project Description
AgreeX is an "all-in-one" platform that **generates, verifies, signs, and custodies smart contracts** between freelancers and contractors, using multi-chain blockchain technology and multiple artificial intelligence agents. The platform integrates **OKX DEX Aggregator v5** to enable payments in any token and automatically releases funds when deliverables meet agreed requirements.

Developed for the **OKX Hackathon 2025**, AgreeX revolutionizes freelance work through OKX DEX ecosystem integration, enabling cross-chain transactions and automatic token swaps for maximum payment flexibility.

## Problem We Solve
Freelancers, especially newcomers, often make verbal agreements or use ambiguous contracts, leading to risks of:
- Late or non-payment
- Unilateral changes to terms
- Disputes over deliverables
- Lack of legal guarantees

## Value Proposition
AgreeX with OKX DEX enables any freelancer or contractor to:
- Create solid contracts in minutes on multiple blockchains
- Validate identities seamlessly using decentralized technology
- Receive/release payments in any token via OKX DEX
- Execute automatic swaps to pay in preferred tokens
- Operate on 6 major chains: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, and BSC
- Reduce transaction costs by choosing the most efficient chain

### Multi-Agent System
![orquestador_ia](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/590a0294-5510-4756-863e-fa3621ab93cf)

### Architecture Components
Our system is based on a multi-agent architecture that includes:

- **Supervisor (Orchestrator)**: Coordinates and validates the entire process
- **Legal Agent**: Verifies applicable local laws and regulations
- **Projects Agent**: Incorporates best practices (ISO 9001/27001, CMMI)
- **Testing Agent**: Verifies deliverables through OCR and visual analysis
- **Writing Agent**: Generates clear and understandable legal language

## MVP (Code)
The MVP code is located in the `/mvp` folder of this repository and includes:

- **Smart Contracts**: EVM-compatible Solidity, deployable on 6 chains
- **Backend API**: Express.js with complete OKX DEX API v5 integration
- **AI Agent System**: Automatic milestone verification with OKX DEX
- **Swap Integration**: Automatic token exchange via OKX DEX Aggregator
- **Multi-chain Support**: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, BSC

## Workflow with OKX DEX
1. Chatbot collects information and preferred chain
2. AI agents iterate until contract is approved
3. Contract in JSON format ‚Üí PDF/HTML
4. e-KYC (selfie photo + ID + email OTP)
5. Multi-chain digital signature
6. Smart contract deployed on chosen chain
7. Client deposits funds in any token
8. AI testing validates deliverables
9. OKX DEX executes swap if necessary
10. Blockchain automatically releases funds to freelancer

## Technologies Used
- **OKX DEX Aggregator v5**: Multi-chain swaps and best price
- **EVM Smart Contracts**: Solidity compatible with 6 major chains
- **LLMs (OpenAI)**: Contract generation and verification
- **Vision AI + OCR**: Document validation
- **Multi-chain Infrastructure**: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, BSC
- **IPFS**: Decentralized storage
- **Express.js + Node.js**: Backend API
- **Ethers.js**: Blockchain interaction
